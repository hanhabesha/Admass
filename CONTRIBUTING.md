## ðŸŽ‰ Contribute

ðŸ˜ƒ Thanks for deciding to contribute to the project.

As of now, the project contains **OVER 10K LINES OF CODE**.

Recently, it is migrated to use [Provider](https://github.com/rrousselGit/provider) for its state management. At few, places `StatefulWidgets` are still present.

The project supports sorting of music based on media metadata tags & native playback directly from file explorer etc. The whole user interface strictly follows the material design guidelines.

Checkout [project structure](https://github.com/alexmercerind/harmonoid#-project) to get started. You may also join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZG7Pj9SREG). New Flutter developers are also welcomed.

The plan of project is to bring the best, cross platform music experience for all users. Fork the project today & add your features. We are actively looking for contributors. If you decide to contribute, add yourself to the about page of the app.
